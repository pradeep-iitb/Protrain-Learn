# Interaction & Training Design

Goals: interactive, creative, realistic, impactful.

- Borrower Personas: hardship/anxious, willing/forgetful, angry/resistant, confused/terms.
- Dynamic Emotion Model: internal borrower state (calm ↔ angry, trust ↔ distrust). Agent empathy and clarity moves state toward resolution; confrontational language escalates.
- Compliance Guardrails: model instructed to avoid PII, legal threats; evaluator checks disclosures and prohibited conduct.
- Coaching Moments: after risky agent utterances, nudge prompts appear: "Try reflective listening" or "Offer two repayment options." Optional real-time hints toggle.
- Feedback Rubric: empathy, tone, compliance (0–10) + 3–5 concise suggestions and a 1–2 sentence summary.
- Progression: track multiple sessions and show trend lines per metric; unlock tougher personas as scores improve.
- Usability: large mic controls, clear chat transcript, color-coded roles, one-click Evaluate and Reset.

This design guides prompts and UI decisions to feel like authentic practice while reinforcing good behaviors.
