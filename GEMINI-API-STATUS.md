## The Problem & Fix

### ❌ What Was Wrong:
Your code was using `gemini-1.5-flash` which is an **outdated model name** that Google has deprecated.

### ✅ What Was Fixed:
Updated `server/src/routes.js` to use `gemini-2.5-flash` (current version)

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// OLD (not working):
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-flash' });

// NEW (working):
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-2.5-flash' });
```

## How to Verify It's Working

### Method 1: Run Test Scripts (Easiest)

We created 3 test scripts for you:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Pradeep Kumawat\.vscode\Protrain\server"

# Quick test (recommended)
node test-api-direct.js

# Comprehensive test
node test-gemini-simple.js

# Full test suite
node test-gemini.js
```

### Method 2: Use the Web App

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```powershell
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd "c:\Users\Pradeep Kumawat\.vscode\Protrain\server"
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd "c:\Users\Pradeep Kumawat\.vscode\Protrain\client"
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Lesson 3:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/lessons
   - Click "Professional Debt Collection" (Lesson 3)
   - Start Level 1
   - Have a conversation with the AI
   - If AI responds → API is working! ✅

3. **Test Trainer Page:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/trainer
   - Select a level/persona
   - Click "Start" and have a conversation
   - Click "Evaluate"
   - If you get scores → API is working! ✅
